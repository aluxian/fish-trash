# fish-trash

Safe `rm $file`, equivalent to `mv $file ~/.Trash/` but using Finder, for fish üêü shell.

## Install

### [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)

```fish
fisher add aluxian/fish-trash
```

## Features

- It uses AppleScript to ask Finder to move the specified files/folders to the trash, so the "put back" feature is preserved.
- Unlike [trash](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/trash) in Homebrew, you don't need to use a `-F` flag all the time to use Finder.
- It is compatible with and can successfully trash files from APFS volumes.
